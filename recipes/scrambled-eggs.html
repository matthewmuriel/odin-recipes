    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        Scrambled eggs are a simple and popular dish made by 
        whisking eggs and cooking them in a hot pan. 
        The texture can vary from soft and creamy to light and fluffy, 
        depending on how they're cooked. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        To prepare them, eggs are beaten with a little salt, pepper, and sometimes milk or cream for added richness. 
        The mixture is then poured into a greased skillet over medium heat and gently stirred or folded as it cooks, 
        forming soft curds.
         Scrambled eggs can be served plain or topped with herbs, cheese, or vegetables for added flavor.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Eggs
        </li>
        <li>
            Butter
        </li>
        <li>
            Cheese
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Crack the eggs into a bowl: Break the eggs into a bowl and add a pinch of salt and pepper. You can also add a tablespoon of milk or cream if you like your eggs creamier.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk the eggs: Using a fork or whisk, beat the eggs until the yolks and whites are well combined and the mixture is a bit frothy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat the pan: Place a non-stick skillet or frying pan over medium-low heat. Add the butter or oil and let it melt, ensuring it coats the pan evenly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour the eggs into the pan: Once the butter has melted and started to sizzle lightly, pour the beaten eggs into the pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir gently: As the eggs begin to cook, use a spatula to gently stir and fold the eggs from the edges of the pan toward the center. This ensures even cooking and creates soft curds.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook to desired consistency: Continue stirring until the eggs reach your preferred textureâ€”soft and creamy or firm and fluffy. Be careful not to overcook them, as scrambled eggs can dry out quickly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove from heat: When the eggs are almost done but still slightly undercooked, remove the pan from the heat. The residual heat will finish cooking them.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve immediately: Transfer the scrambled eggs to a plate and enjoy! You can add toppings like cheese, herbs, or vegetables if desired.
        </li>

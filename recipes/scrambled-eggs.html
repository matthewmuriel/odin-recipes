    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        Scrambled eggs are a simple and popular dish made by 
        whisking eggs and cooking them in a hot pan. 
        The texture can vary from soft and creamy to light and fluffy, 
        depending on how they're cooked.

        To prepare them, eggs are beaten with a little salt, pepper, and sometimes milk or cream for added richness. 
        The mixture is then poured into a greased skillet over medium heat and gently stirred or folded as it cooks, 
        forming soft curds.
         Scrambled eggs can be served plain or topped with herbs, cheese, or vegetables for added flavor.
